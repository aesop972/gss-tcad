I will give great thanks to the developers of PETSC, which is the best algebraic package
since BLAS/LAPACK.

I would also thank Jonathan Richard Shewchuk for his Triangle code, a perfect
mesh generator. The Triangle code is used as preprocessor and mesh refiner in GSS.

At last, CGNS system developed in NASA... oh, it is free but really hard to use and troubles me much.
