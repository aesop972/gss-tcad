How to compile GSS

You should install some important libraries first. 
        1 libtiff, most linux distributions have this library already been installed.       
	2 petsc-2.3.3, since petsc often changes its function names, you must have this version. 
	3 cgnslib-2.5-1, earlier version has memory leak problem.  
	4 (optional) When mixed-type simulation is required, you should get lateset NGSPICE (from CVS, not rework-17)
	  and configure it with --enable-experimental --enable-ndev arguments.  
Note 1: 
petsc must be configured with --with-clanguage=cxx to support c++ call 
and --with-mpi=0 to disable parallel mechanism. I highly recommend to 
compile a BLAS/LAPACK, since the system's rounting may cause convergence 
problem.

Note 2:
GSS can be compiled with long double float number (default is double) 
to achieve better convergence rate and more accurate result. 
To support long double, configure PETSC with additional arguments:
--with-precision=longdouble --download-c-blas-lapack=1
PETSC will compile a special version of Blas/Lapack for long double. 


Make sure your compiler works, flex (version 2.5.4, no 2.5.3x) and bison are also needed.

Note:
  Although gcc 3.3/3.4/4.1 works, but vendor compiler (such as Intel icc on PC) 
works much faster (50% faster than gcc). That mainly because the math library 
used by gcc compute pow(x,y) in an inefficient way but icc seems using a hardware
float point arithmatic accelerator.     

You need to set environment GSS_DIR point to the directory of gss.
for example, under bash, 
	export  GSS_DIR=/home/gdiso/gss-0.46
In the directory of gss, type
	configure	
	make
	make install

Note 1:
The default installation dir of cgnslib is /usr/local/lib, if you change
that, use "configure --with-cgns=CGNSdir". More help can be got by "configure --help".
If some library or head file can't be find, you can modify make.def file by yourself.

Note 2:
"Make install" will copy binary file to GSS_DIR/bin and material data file to GSS_DIR/lib	

If everything is ok, add GSS_DIR/bin to your path.
You can goto example directory to check gss.
	gss xxxx.inp

Since gss-0.42.19, A simple text editor is added. Try it with
	gssui
